     <h3>Let's look at some images:</h3>

          <!-- title for next item -->
          <h3>Cats Are Awesome!</h3>
          <!-- description of next item -->
          <p>Look at this one:</p>
          <!-- add appropriate image here (don't forget alt attribute!) -->
          <img src="images\kitten.jpg" alt="">

          <!-- title for next item -->
          <h3>Doggos Are Pretty Cool Too</h3>

     <p>More</p>

<!-- title for next section -->
<div class="quote">
     <h5>Sometimes people say important things</h5>
     <!-- description of next section -->
     You need to document important things that people say so you can sound smart when it's necessary.
     <!-- quote -->
     <q>Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose". - Bill Gates</q>
</div>

<!-- title for next section -->
<div class="deprecated">
     <h5>When it comes to HTML, there are some things you just shouldn't do</h5>
     <!-- description -->
     At least, not anymore...
</div>

<!-- title for next item -->
<div class="bold">
     <h5>Want bold text?</h5>
     <!-- make 'right way' bold first the wrong way, then the right way -->
     There's a wrong way and a <b>right way</b>. Always use the <SPAN STYLE="font-weight:bold">right way!</SPAN>
</div>

<!-- title for next item -->
<div class="italics">
     <h5>Maybe you need some italics?</h5>
     <!-- make 'like this' italic using the wrong method. Make 'right way' italic using the correct method -->
     Again, it used to be done <i>like this</i>. This is wrong. This is the <SPAN STYLE="font-style: italic;">  right way.</span>
</div>

<!-- title for next item -->
<h5>Separation of concerns</h5>
<!-- description -->
The wrong way tags above are deprecated and should not be used. HTML should be used to mark-up or organize your content. It should not be used to style your content or interact with it. Those are the jobs of CSS and JavaScript!

<!-- title for next section -->
<h5>Links</h5>
<!-- make either 'place' in the next body of text a link to your favorite site. (keep it appropriate) -->
Links are one of the most important parts of the web. They help you navigate from <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/" target="_blank">place </a> to place on the internet.

<!-- title for next section -->
<h5>Sections</h5>
<!-- go back through and group each section correctly
     stretch: give each group a class that properly reflects what they represent -->
Section elements are good for grouping elements that belong together. You can also use div's for this
